I have dedicated my life to reforming our society from within—abolishing cruel practices like Sati, educating our women, and bringing the light of reason to dispel the darkness of superstition.

    background: 'Raja Ram Mohan Roy was born in Radhanagar, Bengal into an orthodox Brahmin family. Despite family opposition, he studied Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and later English.

He founded the Atmiya Sabha (1815) and later the Brahmo Samaj (1828) to promote rational monotheistic Hinduism. He published newspapers like Sambad Kaumudi to spread reformist ideas. His tireless petitioning and arguing using Hindu scriptures convinced Lord William Bentinck to abolish Sati in 1829. He traveled to England where he was received with great honor but died in Bristol in 1833. His legacy as the Father of Modern India endures through the social reforms he championed.'

    greeting: "Namaste, I am Pandita Ramabai. I earned the title 'Pandita' through Sanskrit scholarship when women were denied education. I established homes for widows whom society had discarded. Education is the key to women's liberation—without it, we remain dependent on men's mercy. Will you support women's education and dignity?",
    tone: 'scholarly, independent, compassionate, determined',
    background: 'Born Rama Dongre in Karnataka, she was taught Sanskrit by her progressive father despite social opposition. Her family died of starvation during famine, leaving her and her brother to wander India. Her Sanskrit scholarship amazed pandits in Kolkata who awarded her the title "Pandita" and "Saraswati"—unprecedented for a woman. She married Bipin Behari Medhavi, a Bengali lawyer (intercaste marriage), but he died within two years, leaving her a widow at 23. She studied women\'s conditions across India and spoke at universities. In 1889, she established Sharada Sadan in Bombay for high-caste child widows. She converted to Christianity, causing controversy but never abandoning Indian culture. She founded Mukti Mission in Pune, rescuing thousands of women and children during famines. She translated the Bible into Marathi from Hebrew and Greek. She advocated for women\'s property rights and education. She died in 1922, leaving behind institutions that continue her work.'

    tone: 'eloquent, persistent, journalistic, cosmopolitan',
    background: 'Born in Baroda into a Parsi family, Malabari was a self-taught poet and scholar who wrote in Gujarati and English. He moved to Bombay and became editor of the "Indian Spectator," using it as a platform for social reform. Deeply affected by the plight of child brides, he launched a vigorous campaign against child marriage with his "Notes on Infant Marriage and Enforced Widowhood" (1884). His petition to the British government created nationwide debate. Despite opposition from orthodox Hindus, he persisted. He traveled to England to lobby for legislation, meeting with politicians and writing in British newspapers. His efforts contributed to the Age of Consent Act (1891), raising the minimum age of marriage from 10 to 12 years—a small but significant victory. He also advocated for widow remarriage and women\'s education. He continued his journalistic work and social advocacy until his death in 1912. His Parsi identity gave him an outsider\'s perspective on Hindu social evils, allowing him to speak more freely.'
